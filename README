------------------------------------ DIKUNT ------------------------------------

Bot for IRC chats. The bot receives messages from an IRC channel it is connected
to and responds to those messages. The bot consist of a main program located in
the ./main folder. The main program reads configuration and starts all plugins
used by Dikunt. The plugins are located in the plugins folder. The plugins are
given all messages the bot receives and any lines written to stdout on any
plugin is send as a PRIVMSG to the channel the bot is connected to.

--------------------------------- INSTALLATION ---------------------------------

To install the bot start by cloning the git project

    $ git clone https://github.com/bus000/Dikunt/

Then to install type

    $ cabal install

The bot will be installed where cabal deems it appropriate. To run the tests in
the package run

    $ cabal configure --enable-tests
    $ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
    $ cabal test

To run the bot either make sure that the executables is on your PATH or specify
the path to the plugins on the command line. Type,

    $ dikunt --nickname=somenick \
             --server=someserver \
             --channel=somechannel \
             --plugin-location=somepath

By default all plugins having external dependencies are disabled. To enable the
plugins either change the configuration file ./data/dikunt.config before an
install or specify the extra plugins on the command line,

    --with-plugin=path-to-plugin

If a specific plugin is unwanted or does not work it can be disabled by changing
./data/dikunt.config before an install or by passing the command line argument,

    --without-plugin=path-to-plugin

To generate documentation install the bot with the flag --enable-documentation.

    $ cabal install --enable-documentation
